## UFO Analysis with Javascript and HTML



### Overview of Analysis


#### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to create a webpage that would provide an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.

## Results: How to Perform a Search

To allow the user to search through the UFO data, I created a container in the HTML file where the user could input their search and filter the data based on five criteria: Date, City, State, Country, and Shape.

This script now allows for the user to search through the UFO data by using the filter options. Here is the webpage as it exists without any filters:

# Summary

Overall, this webpage provides a useful and practical way for people to get an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings, allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. As with most projects, however, there is room for further development. One of the drawbacks of this webpage is that users must input the search criteria as all lowercase. For example, if a user were to input 'CA' instead of 'ca' in the State filter, the table would not produce data for California. One area of further development would be to allow for users to input whatever their desired case by using the .toLowerCase() function on the value of their search. Another area of further development could be to allow users to click the headers to sort the data by the specified column. For example, if the user wanted to sort the data ascendingly or descendingly by the duration, the user could click the 'Duration' header to sort the data.
